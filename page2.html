<p> My love, words can't express how much I love you, how much you mean to me, and how your presence lights up my world. I know I'm not the best person, but for you, I want to be better. Your smile, your voice, your eyes, your hair, your face—or should I say the cuteness and the power you hold over me—make me feel at home. You're the one I want to be with. Even though the timing might not be perfect, I'm confident you'll always be by my side, even through tough times. We may not talk all day, but you're always on my mind. I love you, and I just want to be with you forever, hoping you feel the same way. You mean everything to me, and you're all I have and all I want. </p>
